Coursera Specialization: IBM Data Science graded assignments


#### The documents The_Battle_of_Neighborhoods_Introduction and The_Battle_of_Neighborhoods_Data are referring to the tasks:

  We explored New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and clustered their neighborhoods. Both cities are very diverse and     are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities   and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. 
  1. A description of the problem and a discussion of the background. (Introduction)
  2. A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem. (Data)
  
  
  
#### The document The_Battle_of_Neighborhoods_Report, The_Battle_of_Neighborhoods_Presentation and neighborhoods_final are referring to the tasks:

   Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over the          course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare    location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the            Foursquare location   data to solve.  
   
  _Introduction where you discuss the business problem and who would be interested in this project. 
  
  _Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data.
  
  _Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis      that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.
  
  _Results section where you discuss the results.
  
  _Discussion section where you discuss any observations you noted and any recommendations you can make based on the results.
  
  _Conclusion section where you conclude the report.
  
  
  1. A link to your Notebook on your Github repository, showing your code. (neighborhoods_final)
  2. A full report consisting of all of the following components (Report)
  3. Your choice of a presentation or blogpost. (Presentation)
  
   
#### The documents google_maps, neighborhoods and postal_codes_canada are referring to the tasks: 
 For this assignment, you will be required to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto.                                                       
     1. Start by creating a new Notebook for this assignment. Use the Notebook to build the code to scrape the following Wikipedia page,         https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, in order to obtain the data that is in the table of postal             codes and to transform the data into a pandas dataframe. (posta_codes_canada)                                                
     2. Now that you have built a dataframe of the postal code of each neighborhood along with the borough name and neighborhood name,           in order to utilize the Foursquare location data, we need to get the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each                     neighborhood. (google_maps)                                                                                           _
     3. Explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. You can decide to work with only boroughs that contain the word Toronto and           then replicate the same analysis we did to the New York City data. It is up to you. (neighborhoods)
